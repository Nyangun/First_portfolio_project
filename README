# Walmart Sales Analysis Project

# Overview
This project delves into the Walmart Sales data, aiming to uncover valuable insights into the performance of branches, product lines, and customer behavior. The dataset, sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, provides a comprehensive view of historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across different regions. The challenge involves predicting departmental sales, considering the impact of selected holiday markdown events.

# Project Objectives
The primary objectives are to gain a deep understanding of Walmart's sales dynamics, identify top-performing branches and products, and explore customer behavior. By analyzing sales trends and patterns, the project seeks to inform strategies for optimizing and improving Walmart's sales approach.

# Dataset Information
The dataset consists of sales transactions from three Walmart branches in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. It encompasses 17 columns and 1000 rows, detailing various aspects of each transaction, such as invoice details, branch information, customer type, product details, pricing, and ratings.
